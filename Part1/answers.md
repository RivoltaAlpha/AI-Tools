## Part 1: Theoretical Understanding (40%)

### 1. Short Answer Questions

#### Q1: TensorFlow vs PyTorch Differences
**Key Differences:**
- **Execution Model**: TensorFlow uses static computation graphs (eager execution available), PyTorch uses dynamic computation graphs
- **Learning Curve**: PyTorch is more intuitive for beginners, TensorFlow has steeper learning curve
- **Production**: TensorFlow better for production deployment, PyTorch better for research
- **Debugging**: PyTorch easier to debug (Pythonic), TensorFlow improving with TF 2.x

**When to Choose:**
- **TensorFlow**: Production systems, mobile deployment, large-scale distributed training
- **PyTorch**: Research, prototyping, educational purposes, complex architectures

#### Q2: Jupyter Notebooks Use Cases in AI
1. **Data Exploration and Visualization**: Interactive data analysis, plotting, and EDA
2. **Model Prototyping**: Rapid experimentation, iterative development, and documentation

#### Q3: spaCy vs Basic Python String Operations
**spaCy Advantages:**
- Pre-trained models for tokenization, POS tagging, NER
- Efficient processing pipelines
- Language-specific optimizations
- Built-in linguistic annotations
- Better handling of edge cases in text processing
